# search-value-length-check

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/search-value-length-check)

This example solves the logical problem in one of my projects.

Let's say that the app implements search input which can filter the contents of a table. This table is populated via backend calls (APIs).

One of the requirements of the app is to only start filtering the table if the user types 3 or more characters into the search field. Otherwise, all of the entities should be listed in the table.
